# Hello there

I'm [Victor Ribeiro][about], a former [3D artist][3d artist] now a software engineer. I have a small [you tube][youtube] channel where I share what I'm working on at the moment. From time to time I publish some [games][games] (although Google removed all my games from Google Play for some ADs misconfiguration that I still haven't fixed yet). There's a lot of cool projects and experiments in my respository, I hope you find them fun | useful | interesting.

See you around!
